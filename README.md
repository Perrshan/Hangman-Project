# Overview

I am trying to enhance my ability to be a multifaceted engineer by learning more coding languages. This project I used the Rust language to make a hangman game using the terminal and the cargo tool that is frequently used by Rust programmers. I love making fun games that can be played so this project was super fun to put together and I enjoy the Rust language.
